# FinalYearProject
This repository house the Final Year Project for Cathal Donohoe and Nathan Garrihy. The project is a CRUD application that has been made in React with a MongoDB Database and a Spring Boot API. The goal of this project was for both of us to improve and increase our skills and to learn and understand new technologies we havent worked with in this method before. A user of the application can create and account, sign in, add items for trade, browse items and contact the owners of those items.

## What is inside the project
<li> A React application
<li> A Spring Boot application wrote in Java
<li> A Latex Dissertation

## What can it do
The main features of the project: <br>
<li> A user can register and login
<li> A user can add items to the available items page
<li> A user can add items to the wanted items page

## Testing the project
To begin with this project, first clone the repository <br>
```git clone https://github.com/CathalDonohoe/FinalYearProject ```
After this you will notice that in the FinalYearProject directory there are multiple subdirectories. <br>
The FrontEnd folder houses the React application. To start this environment direct to the "my-app" directory. Then run: <br>
```npm install``` <br>
```npm start``` <br>
This will open a new tab on your default browser. <br>
Inside the FYPproject directory is the Back End Spring Boot application. To start this environment, open the folder inside an IDE with Java installed on your machine. <br>
Run the ```FyPprojectApplication.java``` and the Spring Boot should run. <br>
Inside the Dissertation directory is the Dissertation wrote in Latex, along with a PDF of the Dissertation.
